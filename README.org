* RGB-D Scribble-based Segmentation Benchmark
** Description
   The RGB-D dataset contains the following
   - The number of RGB-D images is 154, each with a corresponding scribble and a ground truth image.
   - Every image has a resolution of 640 \times 480 pixels.
   - The measurement of the depth images is millimeter.
   - The categorization differentiates between 95 classes.
   - All scenes are indoor.

   | LabeledImages           | This folder includes all images with the naming convention: [scene]_[number]_[image type].png, where scene is either bedroom, kitchen, livingroom or random and image type is either image, depth, scribbles or gt. |
   | RawData                 | In this folder the original data in .xcf format can be found.                                                                                                                                                       |
   | UnalignedDepth          | One can find here all depth images before they were registered.                                                                                                                                                     |
   | rgbd_palette.gpl        | The ground truth and scribble images are converted to indexed mode. The related color palette is saved in this file.                                                                                                |
   | LabelColorMapping.csv   | This file describes which color belongs to which object class.                                                                                                                                                      |
   | displayLabeledImages.py | For visualization this script provides an overview of one image with the associated classes.                                                                                                                        |
   | Calibration             | This folder contains the scripts, parameters and the images which were used for finding the parameters and for registering the depth images.                                                                        |
** Example
   | [[./LabeledImages/kitchen_22_image.png]] | [[./LabeledImages/kitchen_22_gt.png]]        |
   | [[./LabeledImages/kitchen_22_depth.png]] | [[./LabeledImages/kitchen_22_scribbles.png]] |

   For visualizing the point cloud, this matlab script can be used.
   #+BEGIN_SRC matlab :results file :file pointCloud.png :exports both
     figure( 1, "visible", "off" );
     depth = imread('LabeledImages/kitchen_22_depth.png');
     depth = double(depth);
     img = imread('LabeledImages/kitchen_22_image.png');
     surf(depth, img, 'FaceColor', 'texturemap', 'EdgeColor', 'none' )
     view(158, 38)
     print -dpng pointCloud.png;
     ans = "pointCloud.png";
   #+END_SRC
   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:pointCloud.png]]
