* RGB-D Scribble-based Segmentation Benchmark
** Description
   The RGB-D dataset contains the following
   - The number of RGB-D images is 154, each with a corresponding scribble and a ground truth image.
   - Every image has a resolution of $640\times 480$ pixels.
   - The measurement of the depth images is millimeter.
   - The categorization differentiates between 95 classes.
   - All scenes are indoor.

   | LabeledImages          | This folder includes all images with the naming convention \[[\text{scene}]\_[\text{number}]\_[\text{image type].png},\] where scene $\in\{\text{bedroom, kitchen, livingroom, random}\}$ and \\ image type $\in\{\text{image, depth, scribbles, gt}\}$. |
   | rgbd_palette.gpl       | The ground truth and scribble images are converted to indexed mode. The related color palette is saved in this file.                                                                                                                                     |
   | LabelColorMapping.csv  | This file describes which color belongs to which object class.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
   | displayLabeldImages.py | For visualization this script provides an overview of one image with the associated classes.                                                                                                                                                             |
   | RawData                | In this folder the original data in \texttt{.xcf} format can be found.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | Calibration            | This folder contains the scripts, parameters and the images which were used for finding the parameters and for registering the depth images.                                                                                                             |
